        <p>During aerobatic flights, the app uses your watch's accelerometer to measure G-forces in real-time. G-forces are displayed live during the aerobatic sequence.</p>
        
        <h3>Alert System (Optional - OFF by Default)</h3>
        <p>G-force alerts are <strong>disabled by default</strong> to avoid distracting pilots during flight. If you wish to enable them, toggle the switch in Settings and configure the following parameters:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rule 1 - Max G</strong>: Instant alert when maximum G exceeds a threshold (default: 6.0 G). Triggers a discontinuous pattern with 4 pulses over 2 seconds</li>
            <li><strong>Rule 2 - G Threshold</strong>: Alert when G exceeds a threshold (default: 4.0 G) for a sustained duration (default: 5 seconds). Triggers a continuous haptic pattern over 2 seconds</li>
            <li><strong>Rule 2 - Duration</strong>: Minimum time (1-30 seconds) that G-forces must exceed the threshold before triggering Rule 2</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Delta-T Validation Parameter (New in 1.0.1)</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Δt Validation</strong> parameter (100-1000ms, default: 500ms) determines the minimum duration a G-force must be sustained before being recorded as a maximum value. This prevents false peaks from brief arm movements.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lower values (100-400ms)</strong>: More sensitive, captures shorter G-force peaks</li>
            <li><strong>Default (500ms)</strong>: Balanced setting suitable for most aerobatic flying</li>
            <li><strong>Higher values (600-1000ms)</strong>: More strict, only records sustained G-forces from real maneuvers</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Tip</strong>: Start with the default 500ms setting. If you notice the app isn't capturing your peak G-forces, decrease the value. If you see occasional false peaks in the summary, increase the value.

        <h2>16. G-Force Measurement System (Version 1.0.1+)</h2>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <strong>🆕 New in Version 1.0.1</strong>: The G-force measurement algorithm has been completely redesigned with advanced multi-layer filtering and temporal validation to provide significantly more accurate readings during aerobatic maneuvers.
        </div>

        <div class="technical-section">
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Version 1.0.1 introduces a new approach to G-force measurement</strong> using advanced 3D vector analysis, multi-layer filtering, and temporal validation. Here's how the system works:</p>

            <h3>1. 3D Vector Magnitude Calculation</h3>
            <p>Unlike traditional single-axis measurements, the app now calculates the <strong>total acceleration magnitude using all three axes</strong> (X, Y, Z) simultaneously. This ensures accurate readings <strong>regardless of wrist orientation</strong> during complex aerobatic maneuvers such as rolls, loops, or inverted flight.</p>
            
            <p>The system measures the vector norm (magnitude) of the acceleration in 3D space:</p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-family: monospace; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
                G<sub>total</sub> = √(X² + Y² + Z²)
            </p>

            <h3>2. Advanced Multi-Layer Filtering System</h3>
            <p>Raw accelerometer data contains noise from vibrations, arm movements, and aircraft motion. Version 1.0.1 applies a sophisticated <strong>4-stage filtering pipeline</strong> running at 50 Hz (50 samples per second):</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stage 1 - Physical Limit Capping</strong>: Values are clamped to ±10G to reject obviously aberrant readings</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 2 - Median Filter (100ms window)</strong>: Eliminates transient spikes by taking the median of 5 consecutive samples</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 3 - Trimmed Mean (200ms window)</strong>: Averages 10 samples after removing the 20% most extreme values (2 highest + 2 lowest) for robust averaging</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 4 - Low-Pass Exponential Filter</strong>: Applies exponential smoothing to reduce remaining noise while preserving peak values</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>Result</strong>: This multi-stage approach effectively eliminates false peaks from brief arm movements (typically 0.05-0.2 seconds) while accurately capturing real G-forces from aerobatic maneuvers (typically 0.5+ seconds).
            </div>

            <h3>3. Temporal Validation System</h3>
            <p>The most significant improvement in version 1.0.1 is the <strong>temporal validation of maximum values</strong>. To prevent recording false peaks from brief arm movements, the system requires G-forces to be <strong>sustained for a minimum duration</strong> before accepting them as valid maxima.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When a new peak is detected, it becomes a <strong>"candidate maximum"</strong></li>
                <li>The system monitors if the G-force remains within <strong>80% of the peak value</strong></li>
                <li>Only if sustained for the configured duration (default: <strong>500ms</strong>) is it recorded as a valid maximum</li>
                <li>Brief spikes that drop quickly are automatically rejected</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>❌ <strong>Rejected</strong>: +5.3G spike for 0.05 seconds (quick arm movement)</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Accepted</strong>: +2.5G sustained for 0.6 seconds (real aerobatic maneuver)</li>
            </ul>

                <strong>⚙️ Configurable Parameter</strong>: The validation time (delta-t) can be adjusted in Settings → G-Forces Alerts → "Δt Validation" from 100ms to 1000ms (default: 500ms). Pilots can fine-tune this parameter based on their flying style and aircraft characteristics.
            </div>

            <h3>4. Automatic Calibration</h3>
            <p>During your <strong>first positive G maneuver</strong> (typically the initial pull to approximately +2G in a barrel roll or similar figure), the system automatically calibrates by capturing the <strong>reference direction for positive G-forces</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>The calibration process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Waits for G-forces to exceed <strong>2.0 G</strong></li>
                <li>Captures <strong>5 consecutive samples</strong> at this threshold</li>
                <li>Averages these vectors to establish a reliable <strong>G+ reference direction</strong></li>
                <li>This reference remains valid for the entire aerobatic session</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Intelligent G+ / G- Detection</h3>
            <p>The app uses <strong>geometric analysis in 3D space</strong> to distinguish between positive and negative G-forces. The system analyzes the angle between the current acceleration vector and the calibrated reference direction:</p>

            <img src="g-forces-sphere-diagram.jpg" alt="G-Forces 3D Sphere Geometry" class="screenshot" style="max-width: 70%;">

            <p>The detection zones are defined as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>G+ Hemisphere (Green)</strong>: Vectors with angle &lt; 90° from reference direction are classified as positive G-force</li>
                <li><strong>G- Hemisphere (Red)</strong>: Vectors with angle &gt; 90° from reference direction are classified as negative G-force</li>
                <li>The boundary at exactly 90° provides clean separation between positive and negative zones</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>Mathematical principle</strong>: The system uses the dot product between the current acceleration vector and the reference vector to calculate the angle: <code>cos(θ) = (V⃗·R⃗) / (|V⃗| × |R⃗|)</code>. If cos(θ) &gt; 0 (angle &lt; 90°), it's G+; otherwise it's G-.
            </div>

            <h3>6. Alert System</h3>
            <p>The alert system (optional, OFF by default) is based on <strong>absolute G magnitude</strong> for maximum reliability. Alerts are <strong>2 seconds long</strong> with strong haptic feedback:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rule 1 - Discontinuous Pattern</strong>: Instant alert when absolute G exceeds threshold (default: 6.0G). Four pulses spaced 0.5s apart with sound + strong haptic feedback</li>
                <li><strong>Rule 2 - Continuous Pattern</strong>: Alert when G exceeds threshold for sustained duration (default: 4.0G for 5 seconds). One sound followed by continuous haptic feedback over 2 seconds</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>⚙️ Safety Feature</strong>: Alerts are disabled by default to avoid distracting pilots during flight. Enable in Settings only if you are confident they will not interfere with your flying.
            </div>

            <h3>Why This Approach is Better</h3>
            <p>The previous version (1.0) used only the Z-axis perpendicular to the watch screen and accepted instantaneous peak values. This caused two major issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Orientation dependency</strong>: Readings varied wildly with wrist position</li>
                <li><strong>False peaks</strong>: Brief arm movements registered as high G-forces (5-12G from simple gestures)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Version 1.0.1 solves both problems:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ <strong>3D approach is orientation-independent</strong> and provides consistent accuracy regardless of wrist position</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Temporal validation eliminates false peaks</strong> by requiring sustained G-forces, not instantaneous spikes</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Multi-layer filtering</strong> removes noise while preserving real aerobatic data</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>⚠️ Important Safety Notice</strong>: While version 1.0.1 significantly improves accuracy, Apple Watch accelerometer data remains <strong>FOR REFERENCE ONLY</strong>. Always rely on your aircraft's certified instruments as the primary source of flight data. The watch should never be used for critical flight decisions.
        </div>

        <h3>Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the watch is <strong>snugly fitted</strong> to your wrist to minimize movement</li>
            <li>Start the aerobatic activity <strong>before your first pull maneuver</strong> to allow proper calibration</li>
            <li>Adjust the <strong>Δt Validation parameter</strong> (Settings → G-Forces Alerts) based on your flying style:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>300-400ms</strong>: For dynamic, quick figures with brief G-forces</li>
                    <li><strong>500ms (default)</strong>: Balanced setting for most aerobatic flying</li>
                    <li><strong>600-800ms</strong>: For sustained figures and smoother flying styles</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Verify calibration by comparing the displayed values with your aircraft instruments during the first maneuver</li>
            <li>Remember that the watch display should <strong>not be watched during aerobatic maneuvers</strong> - check values after completing figures</li>
            <li>After landing, review the Summary screen to see your maximum G+ and G- values for the flight</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Values seem too low</strong>: Try reducing Δt Validation to 300-400ms in Settings</li>
            <li><strong>Still seeing occasional false peaks</strong>: Increase Δt Validation to 600-800ms in Settings</li>
            <li><strong>No calibration happening</strong>: Ensure you perform a clear +2G pull maneuver early in your sequence</li>
            <li><strong>Inconsistent readings</strong>: Check that the watch is snugly fitted and doesn't move on your wrist</li>
        </ul>
