        <h2>2. Settings: Flight Time Method</h2>
        <img src="02-SettigsFLTTimemethod-46mm.jpg" alt="Flight Time Settings" class="screenshot">
        <p>Select the Flight Time calculation method:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TAKE OFF/LANDING</strong>: Flight time starts at TAKE OFF, ends at LANDING. An optional TAXI FEE is automatically added.</li>
            <li><strong>HOBBS (ENGINE) time</strong>: Flight Time starts on tap ENGINE START, and stops on tap ENGINE STOP. With HOBBS method selected, a H button will appear on ENGINE START screen, at this moment you can enter the HOBBS Departure value. At the end, after ENGINE STOP action, the button HOBB will appear. You can enter the HOBBS arrival value. Those datas are recorded in flight history, there is no control nor calculation on this information.</li>
            <li><strong>BLOCK TIME</strong>: In this case, a Block START button will appear after ENGINE START and before ENGINE STOP. Flight time will start when taping this button and stops on BLOCK STOP.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Please note that</strong> if you tap on BLOCK START then start a <strong>REFUELING</strong> sequence, the flight time will be <strong>RESET</strong>. It will start from zero after <strong>END REFUEL</strong> tap considering that Taxi to refuel and refueling time is not counted in the flight time when BLOCK/BLOCK method. This is the same after landing. If there is a REFUEL operation, Block time will stop and remain stopped until the end.

        <img src="03-SettingsFuelUnit-TaxiFee.jpg" alt="Fuel Unit and Taxi Fee Settings" class="screenshot">
        <p>Select the <strong>FUEL UNIT</strong>. <strong>Note</strong>: A dual fuel unit for distinct flight is not managed. It is only a global display format for all those datas.</p>
        <p>Select <strong>TAXI FEE</strong>: Taxi fee is the value in minutes that is added to the Flight Time when TAKE OFF/LANDING method is selected.</p>

        <h2>4. Settings: G-FORCES Alert Rules</h2>
        <img src="04-SettingsG-Forces-46mm.jpg" alt="G-Forces Settings" class="screenshot">
        <img src="05-SettingsG-Forces2.jpg" alt="G-Forces Settings Detail" class="screenshot">
        <p>During aerobatic flights, the app uses your watch's accelerometer to measure G-forces in real-time. G-forces are displayed live during the aerobatic sequence. You can configure two alert rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rule 1</strong>: Alert when maximum G exceeds a threshold (default 6.0 G)</li>
            <li><strong>Rule 2</strong>: Alert when G exceeds a threshold for a sustained duration (default 4.0 G for 5 seconds)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Remember</strong>: This data is for reference only. Always trust your aircraft's instruments.
        </div>
        <p>The app attempts to distinguish G+ (positive) and G- (negative) based on the accelerometer's Z-axis. However, accuracy depends on how you wear your watch and the orientation of your arm during maneuvers. <strong>The app also tracks absolute maximum G</strong> regardless of direction for reliability <strong>this "absolute" value is used for alerting</strong>. Use this data as reference only.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manual</strong>: You manually press START and STOP for the activity</li>
            <li><strong>Auto Take-Off</strong>: Activity starts automatically at take-off, you press STOP manually</li>
            <li><strong>Auto Take-Off/Landing</strong>: Activity starts at take-off and stops automatically at landing</li>
